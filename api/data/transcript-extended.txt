[Speaker:0] Hi, Alex. Nice to meet you. Hi. So I understand that you were referred here by your GP because you've been feeling quite down recently.
[Speaker:1] Yeah. I thought I should I've been feeling quite bad for quite a while, so I thought maybe it's time to see someone about it because I I don't wanna feel like this anymore. Okay. So,
[Speaker:0] from your notes, I saw that you saw the GP about three months ago. Yeah. So how long have you been feeling down altogether?
[Speaker:1] Quite a few months before that as well, actually. But it's gotten pretty bad these past few months, so that's kind of why I came.
[Speaker:0] Okay. So has it got worse since you saw your GP? Yeah. Okay. So tell me, I mean, how how are things at the moment?
[Speaker:1] Well, it kinda started just feeling a bit low and wound up about things, but I don't know. Just recently, I I just can't really be bothered to do anything at all. I kind of find it hard to get motivated for things and I want to be I really want to be better but it's just kind of reaching the end now where I just I wanna do something about it.
[Speaker:0] Okay. So you said that you're feeling really down, really sad. Yeah. And you feel like you haven't got any motivation. But are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Sorry. Okay. And you haven't got any motivation, but it sounds like you're putting quite a lot of pressure on yourself to try and feel a bit better. Yeah. I just,
[Speaker:1] it's kind of hard as well because there's not really anyone to talk about. So I just kinda stay on my own trying to I don't like to think about it, but
[Speaker:0] I just know.
[Speaker:1] So you've you say you've been, you're feeling quite isolated. There's not many people around. Yeah. There's no one I can talk to about it. No one would listen or understand anyway.
[Speaker:0] Okay. So, I'm just gonna try and find out a little bit more about you. So I understand that you're an English student at uni. Yeah. And, you live away from home with some friends. Is that right? Yeah. I live here. Okay. So you don't you don't live far from the uni. But but you say you feel like, you live with your friends but you don't feel like you can talk to them. Yeah. I mean, they're lovely. I I I get on really well with them but
[Speaker:1] I don't know. I just recently whenever they wanna go out or stuff, I just I don't wanna bring them down. I can't they don't understand what I'm going to. They kind of I don't know. They don't make fun of how I feel but they don't really understand what it's like. I just I don't wanna go out with them and bring them down or stuff.
[Speaker:0] Okay. So it sounds do you try and hide the way you're feeling from them? I guess. I mean,
[Speaker:1] it's easier to hide it than to try and explain it all the time when no one really wants to know.
[Speaker:0] Okay. So it sounds like you've been feeling down. You've been feeling unmotivated. You feel like you want to be better but actually it sounds like you feel like you can't reach out for help. You can't speak speak to anybody.
[Speaker:1] No. I don't really talk to my parents about either.
[Speaker:0] Okay. So that's kind of hard. Okay. I'm just gonna go back in time a little bit. I suppose I'm just wondering when when did all of this start? You said it's been going on for quite a few months. Yeah.
[Speaker:1] I guess it kind of started, when I was actually, when I was revising for my exams. I guess the stress I put a lot of stress on myself. I think I've always wanted to do well for me and I guess for my parents. So the stress of exams and it was also kind of hard because my parents were going through a bit of a a troubled time then.
[Speaker:0] Okay. So this would be, like, last March, last April? Yeah. I I think so. Around that time. So about six months ish. Yeah. And it sounds like a lot was happening. So you had a lot of uni pressure on. And, and you you said that your parents were having marital
[Speaker:1] problems? Yeah.
[Speaker:0] Okay. And it sounds like that was a real shock to you. Yeah. I guess
[Speaker:1] it was hard as well because I wasn't doing well at uni. I don't I guess I just felt a bit guilty. I I know it sounds silly, but I felt like maybe if I could do better, then they would get better. But it just it just wasn't really happening.
[Speaker:0] Okay. So it sounds like you were trying to work hard and Yeah. And be more successful because you thought that that would make them happier and
[Speaker:1] try and fix things. Yeah. I I wanted to make them feel better, but it it just kind of backfired a little, I guess.
[Speaker:0] How did it backfire?
[Speaker:1] Well, it just ended up with them getting worse, and I've just been feeling worse since then.
[Speaker:0] Okay. So after the summer, after the exam period, and how did that exam period go for you in the end? Not very well. Okay. That's an awful lot of pressure to put on yourself that you I suppose to think. It's just annoying because
[Speaker:1] I know I should have done better and I just didn't. And I guess I beat myself up a lot about it.
[Speaker:0] Mhmm. So you say I know I know I should have done better. Yeah. I mean, I suppose that hearing it from my perspective, I'm thinking it sounds like you had an awful lot going on at the time. It would be understandable, absolutely, that you wouldn't do as well as normal. I suppose I'm just wondering if you have very high standards for yourself.
[Speaker:1] Probably. Maybe more than other people. My parents have always kind of taught me not in in a loving way, I guess, but that you should do your best, but also get the best. And I agree with that. I I think that's the right thing to think. But when I don't do that, I don't know. It annoys me a lot, and I worry that it annoys them.
[Speaker:0] So it sounds like you feel you should always do your best. Is that the word you used? Yeah. And that there isn't any kind of exceptions for that but No. Okay. So I can I can see then that that was a really difficult time for you and that was when your mood started to get lower and things are still quite bad now? I mean, what's the situation with your parents at the moment?
[Speaker:1] I think it it doesn't sound good. I don't really talk to them a lot but I don't think they're going through very good. I don't like to talk to them about it because it just makes me feel worse. Okay. But I don't think it's getting any better.
[Speaker:0] Were you home over the summer? For a little bit. Yeah. Mhmm. And how was that?
[Speaker:1] Not very fun. No. It was quite tense all the time. It stressed me out more than relaxed me over the summer, I guess. Mhmm. Okay.
[Speaker:0] Okay. So it sounds like quite a lot has been happening. You've been feeling very low. You've had, uni pressure on. You've had, problems with your parents' marriage. And sounds like you feel that you can't really reach out to to anyone that you can't understand, but you can't really reach out to your parents right now. You can't really confide in your friends. So I suppose I'm just wondering if you can tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling, I mean, say this past week.
[Speaker:1] Really not good, to be honest. I actually if I don't have to, then I don't really leave the house or get out of bed. I just I can't find the motivation for the things I used to join. I used to love doing sports or going out, and now I just prefer to lie in bed and not really do anything. Okay. I missed a few lectures this week that I should have gone to. But
[Speaker:0] Right. So I suppose I'm just wondering and let's see if we can think about one thing, say a lecture. What kind of thoughts do you have about going to that lecture before it happens?
[Speaker:1] I don't really see the point anymore. If if I can't do as well as I should be doing, then what's the point in putting myself in those positions? I just I can't be bothered anymore to to try. It
[Speaker:0] just stresses me out more than I need to. Okay. So it sounds like the kind of thought you've got in your head are it's pointless. It's not worth it. Yeah. Do you have any other thoughts in your head when you're just at that point before you go to the lecture? I feel like
[Speaker:1] I don't know. I I I don't really even deserve to be here if I can't do well enough. I see all these other students that are doing well and doing better and want to be there. I don't know why I'm here even at uni, to be honest.
[Speaker:0] So it sounds like you feel like you're not as good as other people here. Yeah. Okay. I'm just sorry. Is it okay if I take notes as we go through? It's just I'm trying to, I guess, understand what you're telling me and it helps me just to write it down and I'll share this with you later. Gotcha. Okay. So it sounds like those are those are some quite negative thoughts to have. You're kinda saying, you know, it feels like it's pointless. It's more effort than it's worth. And I I don't deserve to be here. I mean, when you have those thoughts, how do you feel?
[Speaker:1] Very unworthy probably would be the best way to put it kind of I don't know, lower than normal. Okay. Because then it makes me think about all the things that I should have been doing better.
[Speaker:0] Okay. So what you described there then you said, I'm unworthy. I should be doing lots of things better. Those are kind of what I would I would call thoughts actually. I suppose I'm trying to understand what it feels like in your gut. What kind of emotions do you feel? Happier? Do you feel sad? Do you what kind of emotions are you feeling when you have those thoughts?
[Speaker:1] Sad. Yeah. Not happiness. No. Sad. I I bit of kind of anger and frustration as well. Okay.
[Speaker:0] I noticed when you're kinda telling me this, and I know this is quite heavy topic, but you're kind of laughing. And I suppose I wonder a little bit, are you a bit you know, how do you feel about having these emotions, talking about these emotions?
[Speaker:1] Yes. Embarrassed. Mhmm. But is I I've never yet to talk about it, so it's quite uncomfortable to be in this situation.
[Speaker:0] K. Well, you're doing a great job because I know I know that this can be difficult. Okay. So it sounds like some of the thoughts you're describing are it's pointless, it's more than it's worth, I I don't deserve to be here, I'm unworthy. And those kind of thoughts, it sounds like they just flip through your mind. And then you're kind of describing different emotions that those lead to. You're kind of describing sad, anger, frustration, embarrassed. What about in your body? What happens? How do you feel kind of physically?
[Speaker:1] I used to be, I think, from those emotions very wound up, very kind of stressed all the time. But recently, it's just been a lot more draining than anything. Just Mhmm. Quite lethargic and I just can't be bothered anymore and it's my body reflects that. But then when I try and sleep, I just can't seem to have a satisfied night sleep. It's really, really frustrating.
[Speaker:0] So it sounds like this is affecting you. It's it's draining you of your energy, like like your body can't be bothered. I think that's a really good way of describing it. And you're you're noticing sleep problems as well. And then what do you do? So this is so we're back to the point before the lecture. So you start having these thoughts, these emotions, and, you know, your body, I guess, it sounds like those thoughts are quite draining, so we're draining your energy. What then happens? What do you do next?
[Speaker:1] I kind of focus on the negative thoughts when I probably should not think about them, but it I focus on them and then I don't really wanna do anything.
[Speaker:0] Kinda stay in bed or So you think even more about those kind of worries that you have so you do a bit of dwelling and you stay in bed. And it sounds like you don't you know, you haven't tried speaking to your friends about it. No. I don't Or speaking to family. Okay. And then after you've done that, so after you've not gone to the lecture, you've stayed in bed, you kinda spent time, as you said, focusing on those those thoughts, those negative thoughts. How do you feel after that? Do you feel better or do you feel worse?
[Speaker:1] I guess I feel slightly worse but then a bit numb in a way kind of Once you've felt that because I do feel tired all the time. I just try and push it out and then you don't really think about anything. And it's almost nicer that way than to keep focusing on how much you're getting wrong and how much you can't do stuff. Sometimes it's better just to not think about it at all.
[Speaker:0] So it sounds like in some ways, it's a bit of a relief to do that. Yeah. But in other ways, maybe you think it might make things worse. Probably in the long run. Yeah.
[Speaker:0] Thank you for sharing all of that, Alex. I’d like us to explore some of the thoughts you’ve described in a bit more detail, if that’s okay. Last time, we talked about how you feel it’s "pointless" to go to lectures and that you feel "unworthy" of being at university. What would you say is the most frequent or strongest of those thoughts when you wake up in the morning?
[Speaker:1] I think the strongest is “I don’t deserve to be here.” It almost greets me before I’m even fully awake, like a voice hovering. It’s so automatic I barely notice it, but it’s there.
[Speaker:0] That sounds really distressing. When that thought “I don’t deserve to be here” comes up, how do you notice it affects your day-to-day activities—beyond lectures?
[Speaker:1] Well, it bleeds into everything. If I plan to go for a run, I think, "Why bother? I’ll just disappoint myself." If I think about calling home, it’s, "Who would want to hear from me? I’ve got nothing good to share." It’s like a filter that strips motivation from anything.
[Speaker:0] It seems like this belief acts like a screen darkening everything else in your life. Let’s pick one activity—running. Suppose you decide you should try a short run. What happens in your mind before you get out of the door?
[Speaker:1] My mind tells me I’ll look stupid if I can’t keep up. That people will think I’m pathetic, that I’ll certainly fail and then feel even worse.
[Speaker:0] That’s a harsh internal dialogue. If we imagine a friend of yours telling you that they won’t run because they’d look pathetic, how would you respond to them?
[Speaker:1] I’d say that’s not true. I’d encourage them to give it a try, that everyone starts somewhere, and that failing at something once doesn’t make someone pathetic.
[Speaker:0] So you actually offer kindness to others in that situation, even though you’re hard on yourself. What do you think it would be like to try giving yourself that same encouragement?
[Speaker:1] I’ve tried, but it feels fake. It’s like talking to myself in a silly voice. My mind contradicts me immediately.
[Speaker:0] That’s understandable—it can be hard to override habitual self‐criticism. One technique that might help is to write down both the self‐critical thought and a kinder, more balanced response. Would you be willing to try that as homework?
[Speaker:1] Yes. I can commit to writing a few statements each evening. It might help me notice the pattern.
[Speaker:0] Great. Let’s call that your first homework: each night, write down the harsh thought and then write the compassionate alternative as if you were talking to a friend. Over time, we’ll see if that changes how automatic the self‐critical voice feels.
[Speaker:1] Okay.
[Speaker:0] Now, another area you mentioned was sleep. You said you find it hard to get a “satisfied night’s sleep.” What does that look like, and how many hours do you usually get?
[Speaker:1] My sleep is broken. I lie awake worrying for hours, sometimes until 3 or 4 AM. Then I’m exhausted the next day, but I can’t nap because I feel guilty for sleeping and worry I’ll make my insomnia worse.
[Speaker:0] That’s a difficult cycle: worry preventing sleep, then guilt preventing rest. For this week, let’s try a brief wind‐down routine, maybe turning off screens an hour before bed and doing a guided relaxation for 10 minutes. You don’t have to sleep right away—that’s beyond control—but you can practice the routine as a signal to your body it’s time to rest. How does that sound?
[Speaker:1] It sounds manageable. I can try the screen break, but I don’t own a recording. Could you recommend one?
[Speaker:0] I’ll send you a link to a free 10‐minute body scan audio. You can use headphones or speakers—whatever feels comfortable. Let’s plan to do that each night before noting your thoughts.
[Speaker:1] All right.
[Speaker:0] You also mentioned feeling like you have no one to talk to and that your friends wouldn’t understand. Would you consider trying a low‐stakes conversation with one friend, simply to explain you’re struggling and ask if they have time to listen?
[Speaker:1] I’d like to, but I’m scared they’ll pull away or think I’m looking for attention.
[Speaker:0] That fear is common. We can role‐play that conversation now. Imagine I’m your friend. How would you start?
[Speaker:1] Maybe: “Hey, I’ve been finding things tough lately. Would you mind if I talk for a few minutes?”
[Speaker:0] That’s a clear, respectful ask. If I were that friend, I’d respond, “Of course, Alex. I’m here.” Then you could describe how you’ve been feeling unworthy and isolated. How does saying those words aloud feel?
[Speaker:1] It feels shaky, but part of me thinks, if I don’t practice, I’ll never manage it for real.
[Speaker:0] Exactly. Let’s make that second homework: practice that ask in front of a mirror or jot it down so it becomes more concrete. Then, if you feel able, reach out to one friend this week. If it doesn’t go perfectly, that’s still valuable practice.
[Speaker:1] I’ll try.
[Speaker:0] Excellent. For our next session, we’ll review how the thought‐record and sleep‐routine went, plus the friend conversation. We’ll also talk about any safety concerns—have you had thoughts of harming yourself or feeling you might act on them?
[Speaker:1] I haven’t had plans or anything like that. Sometimes I think it’d be easier if I just didn’t wake up, but I don’t act on those thoughts.
[Speaker:0] Thank you for sharing that. Those passive thoughts can still feel frightening. We’ll create a safety plan if they intensify. For now, if they worsen, please contact your GP or a crisis line immediately. Do you have any crisis numbers saved?
[Speaker:1] I have Samaritans in my phone.
[Speaker:0] That’s good. Keep it handy. Before we close, is there anything else you’d like to cover today?
[Speaker:1] No, I think that’s enough to start with.
[Speaker:0] Great work today, Alex. You’ve been very open, and these assignments will help us build momentum. I look forward to hearing how you get on. See you next week.
[Speaker:1] Thank you. See you then.
[Speaker:0] (one week later) Welcome back, Alex. How did the thought‐record go over the past seven days?
[Speaker:1] Surprisingly well. I managed to write down five to ten thoughts each night, and sometimes I even caught myself before the day started—I’d see a thought arising and say in my head, “Stop, note this later.” That felt like progress.
[Speaker:0] That’s excellent insight—to notice thoughts in real time. When you wrote compassionate alternatives, did any of them feel convincing?
[Speaker:1] A few. One was, “Even if I don’t get a first‐class grade, it doesn’t define my worth.” It felt true, but I had to repeat it a lot for it to stick.
[Speaker:0] That’s normal. New beliefs need practice to form new neural pathways. Over time, repetition attenuates the old automatic response. How many times did you repeat that one?
[Speaker:1] Roughly ten times across different days.
[Speaker:0] That’s a solid start. Let’s emphasize that thought next and maybe create a short mantra: “Grades are data, not destiny.” How might that feel?
[Speaker:1] It’s catchy. I can try saying that in the morning.
[Speaker:0] Perfect. How about your sleep routine?
[Speaker:1] I did the body scan every night for five nights. It helped me fall asleep faster—usually by midnight—and I woke up less groggy.
[Speaker:0] That’s an important shift. Sleep quality is crucial for mood regulation. Let’s keep that routine and add a morning activity—perhaps a short walk within an hour of waking—to reinforce a healthy circadian rhythm.
[Speaker:1] I can try a walk.
[Speaker:0] Excellent. And did you reach out to your friend?
[Speaker:1] Yes. I texted Sam, asking if we could catch up. He replied kindly, said he’d grab coffee. I told him how I’ve been feeling. He listened and asked questions. It felt scary but reassuring.
[Speaker:0] That’s a big step—well done. How did you feel afterward?
[Speaker:1] Lighter. I was tense beforehand, but afterward I felt... seen. It was like a release.
[Speaker:0] That’s the power of social support. We’ll aim to nurture that connection. Maybe plan another check‐in next week.
[Speaker:1] I’d like that.
[Speaker:0] So, our third homework: develop the “Grades are data, not destiny” mantra and say it aloud each morning; maintain your wind‐down and morning walk; schedule a weekly catch‐up with Sam. Does that feel manageable?
[Speaker:1] Yes. It feels like a plan.
[Speaker:0] Great. Finally, any safety concerns since last week?
[Speaker:1] No.
[Speaker:0] Fantastic. Let’s keep building on these successes. I’ll see you in another week.
[Speaker:1] Thank you.
[Speaker:0] (two weeks later) Hi again, Alex. I’m so pleased to see you today—your progress is noticeable. Tell me about the mornings with the mantra.
[Speaker:1] I say it as soon as I wake, even before I open my eyes: “Grades are data, not destiny.” It still feels strange, but it helps stop the self‐criticism train.
[Speaker:0] Excellent. How about the morning walk?
[Speaker:1] I’ve managed it on four out of seven days, usually a twenty‐minute loop through the park. I feel more alert by my first lecture.
[Speaker:0] That aligns with research: morning light exposure boosts mood. You’re establishing healthy habits.
[Speaker:1] Yes—it’s surprising how small changes add up.
[Speaker:0] Let’s shift now to stress during exam revision. You mentioned before that exam season last year triggered much of your low mood. How might you approach revision differently this time?
[Speaker:1] I’m worried I’ll slip into old patterns—stressing constantly.
[Speaker:0] Right. We can develop a structured revision plan with breaks and social check‐ins. For instance, study for 50 minutes, then a 10‐minute break with a friend or a walk. Would that be realistic?
[Speaker:1] That makes sense. Having scheduled breaks could stop me from overworking.
[Speaker:0] Good. Also, remind yourself of the mantra during revision dips. If you catch a self‐critical thought, pause and apply your compassionate statement.
[Speaker:1] Okay.
[Speaker:0] Lastly today, I want to introduce a brief mindfulness exercise you can do during a break. It’s just one minute of grounding: notice five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, one you can taste. This 5‐4‐3‐2‐1 exercise can re‐orient you when anxiety spikes. Will you practice that this week?
[Speaker:1] I’ll try it. One minute feels doable.
[Speaker:0] Perfect. So this week: morning mantra, morning walks, structured revision slots with 5‐4‐3‐2‐1 mindfulness, and regular check‐ins with Sam. How do you feel about that?
[Speaker:1] Nervous but motivated.
[Speaker:0] That’s a good balance. Growth often sits alongside discomfort. You’re doing great, Alex. See you next time.
[Speaker:1] Thanks.
